# task-manager

This is a personal project I've been working on since the beginning of May, 2016. 

The technology used includes MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and NodeJS.  

To create a reminder, sign up (don't trust my authentication with a password you use elsewhere), and in the Profile page, 
set your receiving email account to your email, or even your phone number, separated by commas.  If you add your phone number,
add it like so: 1112223333@provider.com

Use the following instead of @provider.com<br>
verizon: @vtext.com<br>
t-mobile: @tmomail.net <br>
at&t: @mms.att.net<br>
sprint: @page.nextel.com<br>

<b>(I have not tested any networks besides Verizon)</b>

For sending email: you can use mattstaskmanager@gmail.com for the sender email account and <b>githubtester</b> for the password. 
I don't use this email, you can use it so you don't have to create your own.<br>
I don't do any verification to determine that the email you entered has valid credentials, so be sure you are right.

Then go to add reminder, here you can edit the current sender/receivers if you would like.

Set the date to send the reminder, time to send the reminder (military time only, and the time zone is in Eastern time, 
I will update this shortly), subject, and body.  If you send yourself a text reminder and put a subject, it will always have 
parenthesis wrapped around it.
